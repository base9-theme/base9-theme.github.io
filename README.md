# Base24

An architecture for building themes based on carefully chosen syntax highlighting using a base of 24 colors.

## Why Base24

Base16 is an awesome tool. But it has a few short commings that inspired me to address:

### ANSI Color
ANSI 4-bit color is a standard used in terminals that specify 16 colors to be used by programs in terminals.

However
Base16 does not have enough colors to specify all 16 ANSI colors.





## Get Started

## List of Templates

## Improvements addition to base16
<!-- 1. Lets you specify lighter version colors. -->
1. Better ANSI color support.
a. Support specifying all ANSI 4 bit color
a. Does not override ANSI 256 color palette
a. Enable compatibility mode for programs that only support 256 colors
2. Help you design the scheme based on color science
Does not have hundreds of schemes pre-installed
Support all base16 schemes and templates.
Better looking
