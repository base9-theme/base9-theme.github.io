# Color Palette Guide
This guide describes how to design your own color palette and apply them to
your program.

Each base9 color palette is represented by a string like this:

`282936-E9E9F4-FF5555-FFB86C-F1FA8C-50FA7B-8BE9FD-BD93F9-FF79C6`

It is comprised of 9 colors in hex format:

1. Background. The darkest color ever possible in UI.
It will also be used to mix other color to create darker shades.
2. Normal foreground.
3. Primary color in UI. Signifies importance. Used for headings, buttons.
4. Secondary in UI. Signifies special. Used for quotes, highlights
5. Used for function names, decorators, literals, constants.
6. Used for strings.
7. Used for tags, search matches.
8. Used for symbols.
9. Used for keywords.
